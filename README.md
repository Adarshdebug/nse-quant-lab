# NSE Quant Lab

This is a personal project where I’ve built a multi–page Streamlit dashboard for technical analysis and strategy research on NSE stocks.  
I wanted something that could:

- pull market data without any broking API,
- calculate useful indicators,
- backtest basic trading logic,
- scan multiple stocks at once,
- and show clear BUY/SELL bias.

So I turned that idea into **NSE Quant Lab**.

It’s not a trading bot and it doesn’t place orders anywhere — it’s simply a clean UI to explore market behavior, test simple strategies, and pick stocks with better strength.

## 🚀 What this dashboard does

✔ Live price display  
✔ Moving averages (SMA/EMA)  
✔ RSI & MACD  
✔ Support/Resistance levels  
✔ Volume strength check  
✔ SMA crossover backtesting  
✔ Multi–stock screener  
✔ Ranker that scores stocks out of 100  
✔ Simple pattern hints (double bottom/top)  
✔ Watchlist saved locally (persists after reload)

I’ve tried to bring everything inside a neat UI so it feels like a small terminal.

## 🧠 Motivation

I’ve always liked technical analysis and quant logic.  
Most dashboards online are either behind paywalls or locked inside brokers.  
So I built a lightweight version for myself to visualize:

- stock trend,
- strength,
- risk,
- and statistical edge.

It helped me understand markets more deeply, and also helps as a good portfolio project.
